      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>India stands at a critical juncture in the Anthropocene. As the world's most populous nation with over 1.4 billion people, the country faces compounding climate vulnerabilities that intersect with rapid economic development, agricultural dependence, and extraordinary biodiversity. The empirical evidence emerging from meteorological, demographic, and ecological data reveals patterns consistent with accelerating climate change—patterns that demand urgent scholarly attention and informed policy response. Through this empirical lens, we seek to understand not merely whether India is vulnerable, but how that vulnerability is distributed geographically, what intensities it reaches, and which dimensions of environmental and human systems bear the greatest pressure.</p>

    <section class="chart-section">
      <h3>Chart 1: Warming Rates Across India (1901-2024)</h3>
      <p>This dual-panel visualisation presents India's warming trajectory.  The choropleth map (top panel) shows warming rates measured in degrees Celsius per century across Indian states, with interactive city markers allowing the exploration of individual urban temperature anomalies since 1951. It also presents geographical contrast in warming with northeastern states and parts of the Indo-Gangetic plain exhibiting darker hues indicating warming rates exceeding 1°C per century, whilst some western and southern regions show comparatively moderate rates.</p>
      <p>The bottom panel presents annual temperature anomalies from 1900 to 2024. The data reveal an inflection point around the late 1970s, after which negative anomalies virtually disappear. Warming appears to have spiked especially post-2000s.</p>
      <p>Click on specific cities to see their individual warming trajectory.</p>

      <div class="key-takeaways">
        <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> India's warming is accerlerating, especially over the last two decade, consistent with global climate change patterns documented in IPCC assessmentss. The spatial variation in warming rates suggests that climate impacts will not be uniformly distributed; states experiencing the most rapid warming may face disproportionate adaptation challenges.</p>

    <!-- Chart 2 Section -->
    <section class="chart-section">
      <h3>Chart 2: Extreme Heat Days in India (1967-2024)</h3>
      <p>This two-part visualisation examines extreme heat exposure across Indian states. The top panel presents a horizontal bar chart ranking states by their annual heatwave days (1967–2024), with colour intensity indicating severity. In 2010, Uttarakhand emerges as an outlier with over 32 average heatwave days annually, appearing in the darkest red. States also cluster into noticable groups in the same year: high-exposure northern states (Haryana, Jharkhand, Delhi) averaging 23–27 days; moderate-exposure central states (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha) ranging from 11–20 days; and low-exposure southern states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu) experiencing fewer than 5 days annually. Patterns differ between years but the clusters largely remain. Importantly, the average nu,mber of heatwave days have increased significantly over six decades, showing a concerning pattern.</p>
      <p>The bottom panel displays all-India average heatwave days from 1967 to 2024 as a connected scatter plot. The data exhibit substantial variability, with values oscillating between approximately 2 and 16 days for most of the period. However, years post-2000 clearly face "higher highs."</p>

      <div class="key-takeaways">
        <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> While annual heatwave days vary between years, states are facing "higher highs" in heatwave counts. Additionally, Northern states experience extreme heat burdens. This intensification poses acute risks to public health, agricultural productivity, and outdoor labour.</p>

    <!-- Chart 3 Section -->
    <section class="chart-section">
      <h3>Chart 3: Rainfall Variability Across India (1940-2024)</h3>
      <p>This heatmap visualises rainfall departures from normal patterns over an 84-year-period. Green shades denote surplus rainfall (positive departures), brown/beige tones indicate near-normal conditions, and progressively darker reds signal rainfall deficits, with the darkest approaching -60% departures.</p>
      <p>Several patterns emerge from the data. First, rainfall variability appears endemic across all regions throughout the entire period. Second, the northeastern states (recieving the highest average annual rainfall in India) show dramatic swings from extreme surplus (dark green, +40 to +60%) to severe deficit (dark red, -40 to -60%). Third, the intensity and clustering of deficit years (darker red cells) appear more pronounced in recent decades.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> India's rainfall regime exhibits persistent volatility with increasing deficit intensity in recent decades. The asynchronous nature of state-level patterns (neighbouring states experiencing opposite conditions) complicates national water resource management and agricultural planning in a monsoon-dependent economy.</p>

      <h3>Chart 4: Population Exposure to Climate Hazards</h3>
      <p>The donut charts represent population exposure to floods, droughts, and cyclones,and <u>their combinations</u> categorised by risk levels (Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, Very High). Each segment's size corresponds to the proportion of India's population within that risk category, with colours ranging from dark green (Very Low risk) through beige (Moderate) to dark maroon (Very High risk).</p>
      <p>For individual hazards, the "High" and "Very High" risk categories collectively constitute substantial proportions—approximately 35–45% for floods and droughts, and 25–35% for cyclones. The "Moderate" risk category consistently represents 20–30% of the population across all hazard types, indicating that a significant portion of India's population faces non-trivial climate risks even when excluding extreme categories.</p>
      <p>Examining dual combinations reveals that multi-hazard exposure is substantial: the Flood + Drought panel shows large High and Very High risk segments. In the chart showing all three risks combined, the Very High segment is sizeable, indicating that a non-negligible proportion of India's 1.4 billion people face extreme exposure to floods, droughts, AND cyclones simultaneously.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Climate hazard exposure in India is widespread, with multi-hazard vulnerability affecting substantial population segments. Only ~30% of the population falls into Low or Very Low risk categories, indicating that climate hazard exposure affects the majority at moderate or higher levels.</p>

      <h3>Chart 5: Carbon Emissions vs Carbon Removals of Indian States (2013–2022)</h3>
      <p>This bubble chart presents a state-level assessment of India's carbon dynamics over a decade (2013–2022), plotting CO₂ emissions (x-axis, in tonnes) against CO₂ removals via natural carbon sinks (y-axis, in tonnes), with bubble size representing state population in millions.</p>
      <p>Only northeastern states, barring Jammu & Kashmir and Kerala, remove more carbon than they emit. These are also smaller states. No "large" or "popular" Indian state is a carbon absorber. Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat (large bubbles extending beyond 200 million tonnes annually) remove less than 0.5% of the carbon they emit.</p>
      <p>Temporal patterns show that carbon emissions have increased significantly over the last decade. While this aligns with India's exponential economic growth, it is also largely concerning.</p>

      <div class="key-takeaways">
        <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> In India, emissions vastly exceed natural removal capacity across nearly all states.  High-emitting populous states (Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra) show minimal removals relative to emissions. Even forest-rich states with significant carbon sinks (Andhra Pradesh: 38M tonnes removed) operate at massive deficits when netted against emissions (120M tonnes emitted). Climate response requires both aggressive emissions reduction and ecosystem restoration.</p>

    <!-- Chart 6 Section -->
    <section class="chart-section">
      <h3>Chart 6: India's Biodiversity Under Pressure (1990-2025)</h3>
      <p>This three-panel stacked area chart documents the escalating threat to India's biodiversity across 35 years (1990–2025), categorising species by conservation status: Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable. Each panel corresponds to one threat category, and within each panel, taxonomic groups (Plants, Reptiles, Fish, Birds, Amphibians, Mammals) are represented as coloured stacked areas.</p>
      <p>All three panels exhibit relentless upward trajectories. The Critically Endangered panel (left) shows growth from approximately 60 species in 1990 to nearly 160 by 2025—a 167% increase. Plants (green area) constitute the largest component throughout, expanding from roughly 30 species to over 80. The Endangered panel (centre) displays even more dramatic absolute increases: from roughly 180 species in 1990 to approaching 480 by 2025. Again, Plants dominate, but Mammals and Birds contribute significantly to the growth. The Vulnerable panel (right) mirrors this pattern, growing from approximately 250 species to nearly 500.</p>
      <p>The growth trajectories are not linear. Most panels show acceleration post-2000, with steeper slopes in recent decades compared to the 1990s</p>
      <p>Use the dropdown to examine the trajectory of each taxonomic group in isolation.</p>

      <div class="key-takeaways">
        <p><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong> India's biodiversity crisis is intensifying across all threat categories and taxonomic groups, with no evidence of stabilisation. Threatened species counts have more than doubled across all categories since 1990. Conservation efforts have not arrested biodiversity decline, which both results from and exacerbates climate vulnerability.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
<div class="intro-section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The six visualisations presented in this project collectively illuminate India's climate vulnerability as a multidimensional, spatially heterogeneous, and temporally intensifying phenomenon. Several overarching patterns emerge from the empirical analysis.</p>
    <p><strong>First, acceleration and intensification characterise India's climate trajectory.</strong> Warming has shifted from episodic anomalies to persistent temperature elevation (Chart 1); extreme heat events show increased frequency and intensity post-2010 (Chart 2); and biodiversity decline exhibits accelerating rather than linear trends (Chart 6). These patterns are consistent with global climate science documenting non-linear responses to greenhouse gas forcing.</p>
    <p><strong>Second, spatial heterogeneity demands region-specific responses.</strong> Warming rates vary substantially across states; extreme heat concentrates in northern regions; rainfall variability affects states asynchronously; and carbon dynamics differ dramatically between high-emitting industrial states and forest-rich states. This geographical complexity precludes one-size-fits-all policies.</p>
    <p><strong>Third, vulnerabilities compound rather than merely accumulate.</strong> The population exposure data (Chart 4) reveal multi-hazard vulnerability affecting substantial population segments. When warming, heat extremes, rainfall disruption, and biodiversity loss interact, they generate cascading risks: agricultural failure leads to economic stress, which reduces adaptive capacity, which increases disaster vulnerability, which further strains ecosystems.</p>
    <p><strong>Fourth, the emissions-ecology imbalance illustrated in Charts 5 and 6 reveals a dual deficit.</strong> India's development pathway has generated climate liabilities (emissions far exceeding removals) whilst simultaneously eroding ecological assets (biodiversity loss reducing ecosystem resilience and carbon sink capacity). As climate impacts intensify, the natural systems that might buffer those impacts are themselves degraded.</p>
    <p>The research question posed at the outset finds a sobering answer in these data. Climate vulnerability in India is pervasive, affecting the majority of the population at moderate or higher risk levels. It is intensifying, with recent decades showing clear acceleration across multiple indicators. It is spatially complex, requiring granular rather than generalised understanding. And it is interconnected, with climate, ecological, and human systems exhibiting feedback loops and cascading effects.</p>
    <p>From a policy perspective, these findings suggest several imperatives. <strong>Adaptation infrastructure must be designed for polycrisis scenarios</strong>, addressing multiple concurrent hazards rather than single threats. <strong>Emissions reduction must be coupled with ecosystem restoration</strong>; addressing one without the other is insufficient. <strong>Spatial targeting of resources is essential</strong>; regions exhibiting severe combinations of warming, heat extremes, rainfall disruption, and biodiversity loss require prioritised attention. <strong>Temporal urgency is evident</strong>; the post-2000 acceleration suggests that delay compounds vulnerability exponentially.</p>
    <p>India's climate vulnerability represents one of the 21st century's most consequential challenges, intersecting demography, ecology, economy, and governance at scales that test adaptive capacity. The visualisations offer diagnostic evidence: India's climate trajectory has fundamentally shifted, its ecosystems are under mounting pressure, and substantial portions of its population face compounded climate risks. How India responds through policy, investment, innovation, and societal mobilisation will shape not only its own future but will reverberate globally, given India's demographic weight, economic trajectory, and ecological significance.</p>
